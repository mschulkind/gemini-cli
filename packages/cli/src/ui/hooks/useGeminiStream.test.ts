/**
 * Test stub for T006: Instrument ChatCompressed events.
 *
 * This file is a proposed unit test stub. It documents the intended tests:
 * - mount a component that provides ApiContext with a mock TokenUsageApi
 * - call the returned `handleChatCompressionEvent` and assert the mock update was called
 *
 * Integration tests (T013) will cover end-to-end behavior; this file is a lightweight placeholder
 * to be expanded into a proper unit test that mounts `useGeminiStream` with minimal dependencies.
